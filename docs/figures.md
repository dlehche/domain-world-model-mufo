# Figures

This document contains the core figures used by the MUFO repository.  
For GitHub publishing, Mermaid diagrams are used first so that the figures remain editable, versionable, and easy to maintain.

## Figure 1. Fragmentation of Human Function Knowledge

**Purpose**  
To show that human-function knowledge is still split across anatomy, function, task, assessment, intervention, and records, without a unified computable coordinate system.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    C["Lack of a unified computable coordinate system"]

    A1["Anatomy"]
    A2["Function"]
    A3["Task / Movement"]
    A4["Assessment"]
    A5["Intervention"]
    A6["Records / Data"]

    A1 --> C
    A2 --> C
    A3 --> C
    A4 --> C
    A5 --> C
    A6 --> C
````

**Caption**
Human-function knowledge is not absent; it is fragmented. The central bottleneck is the absence of a unified computable coordinate system.

## Figure 2. MUFO Position and Boundary

**Purpose**
To define MUFO as the knowledge-and-rules substrate of the human functional world, while clarifying what it is not.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    I1["Concepts"]
    I2["Relations"]
    I3["Constraints"]
    I4["Evidence"]
    I5["Governance"]

    M["MUFO = Knowledge-and-rules substrate for the human functional world"]

    O1["State analysis"]
    O2["Risk boundaries"]
    O3["Action entry points"]
    O4["Auditable reasoning"]
    O5["Longitudinal evolution basis"]

    I1 --> M
    I2 --> M
    I3 --> M
    I4 --> M
    I5 --> M

    M --> O1
    M --> O2
    M --> O3
    M --> O4
    M --> O5
```

**Caption**
MUFO is not a diagnosis engine or a treatment protocol. It is the structured substrate for representing and reasoning about human function.

## Figure 3. The Three-Layer MUFO Architecture

**Purpose**
To present the main architecture of MUFO.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    L1["Layer 1: Functional Cooperation Layer<br/>Defines structural topology and constraint skeleton"]
    L2["Layer 2: Human State Parsing Engine<br/>Locates current state, margin, bottlenecks, and risk windows"]
    L3["Layer 3: Human Functional World Model<br/>Models action-conditioned state transition and long-term trajectory"]

    L1 --> L2 --> L3
```

**Caption**
MUFO develops from structural topology to state parsing, and then from state parsing to action-conditioned functional world modeling.

## Figure 4. MUFO in the Multi-Scale Biological World-Model Stack

**Purpose**
To show MUFO’s strategic position in the broader biological world-model hierarchy.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    S0["L0 Physics / Chemistry"]
    S1["L1 Molecular Structure"]
    S2["L2 Molecular Interaction"]
    S3["L3 Biological Mechanism"]
    S4["L4 Human Functional Dynamics<br/><b>MUFO Strategic Center</b>"]
    S5["L5 Behavior and Task"]
    S6["L6 Clinical and Decision"]

    S0 --> S1 --> S2 --> S3 --> S4 --> S5 --> S6
```

**Caption**
MUFO is not centered on molecular structure or generic decision summaries. Its strategic target is L4: Human Functional Dynamics.

---

## Figure 5. L5 Task Outcome vs L4 Functional Dynamics

**Purpose**
To distinguish ordinary task-result evaluation from MUFO’s deeper focus on functional dynamics.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    L5["L5 Behavior / Task Layer<br/>Can the task be completed?<br/>How much can be completed?<br/>How does the performance look?"]

    A["MUFO pushes one layer downward"]

    L4["L4 Human Functional Dynamics<br/>What stability domain supports the task?<br/>Has compensation been activated?<br/>Where is the risk boundary?<br/>Should the next step be progression, degradation, or retesting?"]

    L5 --> A --> L4
```

**Caption**
Many traditional scales stop at task completion. MUFO pushes downward into the functional-dynamics layer.

---

## Figure 6. Action–State–Memory Feedback Loop

**Purpose**
To illustrate the minimum closed loop of the human functional world model.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    O["Observation Input"]
    P["State Parsing"]
    R["Risk and Constraint Evaluation"]
    A["Candidate Action"]
    E["Execution and Recheck"]
    W["Memory Writeback"]
    C["Recalibration"]

    G["Safety Guardrails"]

    O --> P --> R --> A --> E --> W --> C
    C --> P

    G -. constrains .-> R
    G -. constrains .-> A
```

**Caption**
A functional world model does not stop at recommendation. It must include guardrails, execution, recheck, writeback, and recalibration.
